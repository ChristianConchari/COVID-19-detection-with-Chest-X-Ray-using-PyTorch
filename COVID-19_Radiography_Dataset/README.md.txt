*****COVID-19 CHEST X-RAY DATABASE

A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. This COVID-19, normal and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. In the first release we have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, we have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, we have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19 positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection) and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.  


**COVID-19 data:
-----------------------
COVID data are collected from different publicly accessible dataset, online sources and published papers.
-2473 CXR images are collected from padchest dataset[1].
-183 CXR images from a Germany medical school[2].
-559 CXR image from SIRM, Github, Kaggle & Tweeter[3,4,5,6]
-400 CXR images from another Github source[7].


***Normal images:
---------------------------------------- 
10192 Normal data are collected from from three different dataset.
-8851 RSNA [8]
-1341 Kaggle [9]


***Lung opacity images:
---------------------------------------- 
6012 Lung opacity CXR images are collected from Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) CXR dataset  [8]

***Viral Pneumonia images:
---------------------------------------- 
1345 Viral Pneumonia data are collected from  the Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database [9]

***Formats
    - All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and resolution are 299*299 pixels.

****Objective
    -  Researchers can use this database to produce useful and impactful scholarly work on COVID-19, which can help in tackling this pandemic.
